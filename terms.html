          These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("you" or

      <!-- 1. Overview of the Service -->
      <section>
        <h2>1. Overview of the Service</h2>
        <p>
          SuperDuper is an adaptive family logistics platform that uses artificial intelligence to help
          parents and guardians manage schedules, events, and activities. The Service operates by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Connecting to data sources you authorize (such as email and calendar accounts)</li>
          <li>Using AI systems to interpret and extract relevant family logistics information</li>
          <li>Generating personalized application features, views, and interfaces tailored to your family</li>
          <li>Continuously adapting those features based on data and usage patterns</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Adaptive Nature of the Service.</strong> Unlike traditional software with fixed features,
          SuperDuper dynamically generates and modifies functionality. Features, layouts, and capabilities
          may differ between users and may change over time. You acknowledge and accept this adaptive
          behavior as a fundamental characteristic of the Service.
        </p>

      <!-- 2. Eligibility and Account Registration -->
      <section>
        <h2>2. Eligibility and Account Registration</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Eligibility</h3>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old and capable of forming a binding contract to use the Service.
          The Service is intended for adults—parents, guardians, and caregivers. Children are not permitted
          to create accounts or use the Service directly.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Account Registration</h3>
        <p>To use certain features, you must create an account. You agree to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide accurate, current, and complete information</li>
          <li>Maintain and promptly update your account information</li>
          <li>Maintain the security and confidentiality of your credentials</li>
          <li>Be responsible for all activity occurring under your account</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Shared Family Accounts</h3>
        <p>
          The Service allows multiple parents or guardians to participate in a shared family account.
          By inviting others to or joining a family account, you consent to sharing extracted logistics
          information (such as schedules, events, and activities) with other members of that account.
          You are responsible for ensuring that invited users understand and agree to these Terms.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- 3. AI-Generated Content and Adaptive Features -->
      <section>
        <h2>3. AI-Generated Content and Adaptive Features</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Nature of AI-Generated Content</h3>
        <p>
          The Service uses artificial intelligence to generate summaries, interfaces, notifications,
          and other outputs ("AI-Generated Content"). You acknowledge that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>AI-Generated Content is produced automatically by machine systems</li>
          <li>AI-Generated Content may contain errors, omissions, or inaccuracies</li>
          <li>Accuracy depends on the quality and completeness of source data</li>
          <li>You are responsible for reviewing and verifying AI-Generated Content before relying on it</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Adaptive Application Behavior</h3>
        <p>
          The Service may automatically add, modify, or remove features without prior notice based on
          system interpretation of your data and usage. Such changes are part of the Service's normal
          operation and may not always align with your preferences.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 No Guarantee of Accuracy or Completeness</h3>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            <strong>THE SERVICE IS A CONVENIENCE TOOL AND IS NOT INTENDED TO BE YOUR SOLE SOURCE OF
            SCHEDULING OR LOGISTICS INFORMATION.</strong> We do not guarantee complete, accurate, or
            timely capture or interpretation of information. Missed events, incorrect information, or
            system failures may occur, and you agree not to hold us liable for resulting consequences.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>3.4 User Corrections and Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          If you provide corrections or feedback, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide
          license to use that feedback to improve the Service, including through aggregated and
          de-identified analysis. As described in our Privacy Policy, we do not use your personal data
          to train AI models.

        <h2>4. Data Access and Authorization</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Connected Accounts</h3>
        <p>
          By connecting third-party accounts (such as email or calendar services), you represent that
          you have authority to grant such access and authorize us to access and process data as described
          in our Privacy Policy. Our access is read-only. We cannot send emails, modify calendars, or
          take actions in connected accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for any consequences arising from your authorization, including compliance
          with third-party terms.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 Data Processing</h3>
        <p>
          Our data collection, use, and protection practices are described in our Privacy Policy, which
          is incorporated into these Terms by reference.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Revoking Access</h3>
        <p>
          You may revoke access to connected accounts at any time. Revocation stops future data access
          but does not automatically delete previously extracted information unless you request deletion.

          on our website and may change with notice before your next billing cycle.
        </p>

        <h3>5.3 Automatic Renewal</h3>
        <p>
          Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled before renewal. You authorize us to charge
          your payment method for applicable fees.

          You and SuperDuper agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating
          to these Terms or the Service ("Disputes") will be resolved by binding individual arbitration
