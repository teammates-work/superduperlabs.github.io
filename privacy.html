      <!-- Introduction -->
      <section class="intro">
        <p>
          Super Duper, a product of Ogdenville, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us"), provides an adaptive family
          logistics platform that helps parents and guardians manage schedules, events, and activities. We understand that you're
          trusting us with information about your family—including your children. We take that trust
          seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how we protect it,
          and your rights regarding that information. We've written this policy to be clear and direct,
          not to obscure our practices in legal jargon.
        </p>
        <div class="callout callout-accent">
          <p>
            <strong>The Short Version:</strong> We collect family data to make the app useful to you.
            We don't sell your data. We don't use it to train AI models. We don't share it with
            advertisers. Period.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- 1. Who This Service Is For -->
      <section>
        <h2>1. Who This Service Is For</h2>
        <p>
          Super Duper is designed for <strong>adults</strong>—parents, guardians, and caregivers—who
          manage family schedules. While the app processes information about children (names, activities,
          schedules), <strong>the app is not intended for use by children</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not knowingly allow children under 13 to create accounts or use our service.
          If you believe a child has created an account, please contact us immediately and we will
          delete it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- 2. Information We Collect -->
      <section>
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Account Information</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Your name and email address</li>
          <li>Authentication credentials (we use industry-standard OAuth; we never see your email password)</li>
          <li>Payment information (processed by our payment provider; we don't store card numbers)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Family Information</h3>
        <p>To provide our service, we process information about your family members, which may include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Names of family members, including children</li>
          <li>Schedules, appointments, and activities</li>
          <li>Schools, sports teams, and extracurricular organizations</li>
          <li>Contact information for coaches, teachers, and other caregivers</li>
          <li>Relationships between people (e.g., "Coach Mike" is associated with "soccer practice")</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Connected Account Data</h3>
        <p>
          When you connect your email or calendar, we access data from those services to extract
          relevant family logistics information. See Section 3 for detailed information about email handling.
        </p>

        <h3>Usage Information</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>How you interact with the app (features used, corrections made)</li>
          <li>Device information (browser type, operating system)</li>
          <li>Error logs and performance data</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- 3. Email Access and Handling -->
      <section>
        <h2>3. Email Access and Handling</h2>
        <p>
          Email access is core to how Super Duper works—we extract family logistics information from
          school newsletters, activity schedules, and appointment confirmations. Given the sensitivity
          of email, we want to be explicit about our practices.
        </p>

        <h3>How We Filter Your Email</h3>
        <p>
          We don't process all your email. Most of your inbox never reaches our AI systems at all.
          We use a multi-stage filtering process:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Automatically discarded:</strong> Shipping notifications, login codes, password resets,
            social media alerts, and payment receipts are filtered out immediately based on sender patterns—they
            never touch any AI system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fast-tracked as relevant:</strong> Emails from .edu domains and known kid-logistics
            platforms (e.g., TeamSnap, ClassDojo, Konstella) proceed directly to processing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Evaluated for relevance:</strong> Remaining emails are assessed using sender and subject
            line. For uncertain cases, we may examine a preview of the email content to determine if it's
            family-related.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For most users, only a small fraction of their inbox is actually processed by our AI systems.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h3>What We Do</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Access emails you've authorized us to process (via OAuth with limited, read-only scopes)</li>
            <li>Filter aggressively so most email never reaches AI processing</li>
            <li>Extract scheduling and logistics information (dates, times, locations, people)</li>
            <li>Store extracted information (the "what, when, where, who" of events) with a link back
            to the original email</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="callout callout-red">
          <h3>What We Never Do</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Process emails unrelated to family logistics (automatically filtered by sender and content patterns)</li>
            <li>Store complete email contents long-term (we extract data, then discard the raw email)</li>
            <li>Share email contents with third parties (except our AI processors, under strict agreements)</li>
            <li>Use your emails for advertising or marketing purposes</li>
            <li>Sell or license access to your email data</li>
            <li>Allow our AI providers to train on your email contents</li>
            <li>Compose or send emails—we have read-only access and cannot send emails
            from your account, reply to messages, or take any action in your inbox</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>What We Store vs. What We Discard</h3>
        <p>
          For the small percentage of emails that are relevant, here's exactly what we keep and what we don't:
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p><strong>We store:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>A link back to the original email (so you can verify the source)</li>
            <li>Sender name and email address</li>
            <li>Subject line</li>
            <li>Our generated summary of what's relevant</li>
            <li>Structured data: events, dates, times, locations, people involved, action items</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>We discard:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The full email body</li>
            <li>Email headers beyond sender information</li>
            <li>Attachments</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          Think of it like a friend reading your email and telling you "soccer practice moved to
          Wednesday at 5pm." We remember the takeaway, not the entire message.
        </p>

        <h3>Human Access to Your Email</h3>
        <p>
          Our team does not have access to read your raw email content. If you report a bug or issue
          that requires us to examine your email data to diagnose the problem, we will require your
          explicit permission first. Any such access is logged, limited to the specific issue, and
          revoked once the problem is resolved.
        </p>

        <h3>Revoking Email Access</h3>
        <p>You can disconnect your email at any time through your account settings. When you do:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We immediately stop accessing your email</li>
          <li>Previously extracted information remains in your account (you can delete this too)</li>
          <li>You can also revoke access directly through your email provider's security settings</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- 4. Other Connected Accounts -->
      <section>
        <h2>4. Other Connected Accounts</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond email, Super Duper may connect to other data sources you authorize, such as calendars,
          to provide a more complete picture of your family's schedule.
        </p>
        <p>For all connected accounts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We access only data relevant to family logistics</li>
          <li>We extract useful information and do not retain raw data long-term</li>
          <li>We never share your data with advertisers or use it to train AI models</li>
          <li>You can disconnect any account at any time through your settings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As we add support for new data sources, this policy will be updated to reflect any
          source-specific practices but the core principles outlined above will always apply.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- 5. AI Processing and Model Training -->
      <section>
        <h2>5. AI Processing and Model Training</h2>
        <p>
          Super Duper uses artificial intelligence to understand your family's information and generate
          personalized applications. We want to be completely transparent about how this works.
        </p>

        <div class="callout callout-green">
          <h3>Our Commitment: Your Data Is Not Training Data</h3>
          <p>
            We do not use your personal information to train AI models—not ours, and not anyone else's.
            Your family data is used solely to provide you with our service.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>How We Use AI</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> We use AI to extract meaningful information from your
          emails and calendars (identifying people, events, and relationships)</li>
          <li><strong>Generation:</strong> We use AI to create and customize your family's application
          interface</li>
          <li><strong>Adaptation:</strong> We use AI to suggest improvements based on how you use the app</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Third-Party AI Providers</h3>
        <p>
          We use third-party AI models to power our service.
          Here's what you need to know:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Processing Agreements:</strong> We have contractual agreements with all AI
            providers that explicitly prohibit them from using your data to train their models
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>API-Only Access:</strong> We use these services through their commercial APIs,
            which have stronger privacy protections than consumer products
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Data Retention:</strong> Our agreements specify that AI providers
            do not retain your data beyond the immediate processing request
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What "No Training" Means Specifically</h3>
        <p>
          To be precise: when your data passes through an AI model, it is processed and a response
          is returned. Your data does not get added to any training dataset, influence model weights,
          or get used for reinforcement learning. It is not retained for any purpose beyond completing
          your request.
        </p>

        <h3>Operational Tools and Service Providers</h3>
        <p>
          Like virtually all modern software, we use trusted operational tools for error monitoring,
          performance tracking, and system reliability. These tools
          may process limited data as part of normal operations. All such providers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Operate under Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) that restrict how they handle your data</li>
          <li>Are prohibited from using your data for their own purposes</li>
          <li>Are required to maintain appropriate security standards</li>
          <li>May only retain data for operational purposes (debugging, reliability) for limited periods</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is standard industry practice for maintaining a reliable, secure service. These operational
          tools do not use your data for training AI models or for any purpose beyond supporting our
          service to you.
        </p>

        <h3>Shared Family Accounts</h3>
        <p>
          Super Duper allows multiple parents or guardians to be part of the same family account.
          Here's how data sharing works in shared accounts:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Consent to Share:</strong> By participating in a shared family account and
            connecting your email, you consent to other family members seeing the extracted summaries
            from your email (e.g., event details, schedules, activities)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dashboard Visibility:</strong> All members of a family account can see all items
            on the shared dashboard, including information extracted from any connected email account
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Raw Email Remains Private:</strong> Other family members never have access to
            your raw email content—only the extracted logistics summaries appear on the dashboard
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Optional Connection:</strong> Each parent can choose whether to connect their
            own email for extraction. You can participate in a family account without connecting your email.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you're uncomfortable with other family members seeing your extracted email summaries,
          you can disconnect your email at any time while remaining a member of the family account.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Information About Children</h2>
        <p>
          Our service processes information about children as part of family logistics management.
          We want to be clear about our approach:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Parental Control:</strong> All information about children is provided and
            controlled by their parents or guardians
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Limited Collection:</strong> We collect information about children relevant to
            scheduling and activities (names, schedules, teams, activities)—not academic records,
            grades, or sensitive educational data
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Marketing:</strong> We never use information about children for marketing
            or advertising purposes
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Parental Access:</strong> Parents can access, modify, or delete any information
            about their children at any time
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Future Integrations</h3>
        <p>
          We may add integrations with youth sports platforms, activity management tools, and similar
          services to improve our ability to track your children's schedules. Any such integrations
          will require your explicit authorization and will be limited to scheduling and logistics
          information—not academic performance or grades.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have questions about our handling of children's information, please contact us at
